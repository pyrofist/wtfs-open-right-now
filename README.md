# wtfs-open-right-now
From an idea that was tossed around by some former coworkers of not knowing what was open after a night of gaming/drinking/distractions/what have you.

I previously made a Ruby on Rails version, but gave up on maintaining/developing for it because I realized that I had made some poor decisions with the database as well as having added features that were uneccessary. I thought it would be better to have a fresh start rather than agonize over what portions were salvageable and what portions had to be redone entirely.

Learning/familiarizing myself with Python and Flask for making web apps.

Eventually also to play around with HTML/CSS/JS.
